- What is Github Actions?
- Github actions is powerful continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) platform provided by GitHub.it simplifiles the process of building,testing and deploying code directly-from the github repositories.
- to create workflow in Github Actions,you can use the YAML-based configuration file.Each step represents a task,such as building your code,running tests or deploying it to a server.
- By using the github actions you can define your workflow in a simple and straightforward manner.
- Now, Let's Begin the Deployment Process !!!
- Step 1: Create a New Repository
- Step 2: Add and Commit Code to GitHub Repository
-     Once the repository is created, add your Portfolio app's code to it. Use the git commands to commit the code and push it to your GitHub repository or use the github UI
- Step 3: Create an S3 Bucket
 - AWS Management Console and create an S3 Bucket.Remember to select a region for the bucket. Also allow public access.
- Step 4: Configure Bucket Policy for Public Access
    - To allow public access to the objects in your S3 Bucket, you need to set up a bucket policy.Navigate to the bucket's properties, select "Permissions," and click on "Bucket Policy." Add the following policy
    - {
    - "version":"2012-10-17",
    - "statement":[
    -      {
    -  "Sid":"PublicReadForGetBucketObjects",
    -  "Effect":"Allow",
    -  "Principal":"*",
    -  "Action": "S3:GetObject",
    -  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket name>/*"
    -      }
    -    ]
    -    }
    -    Step 5: Create an IAM User and Generate Security Credentials
    -    Assign the necessary IAM policies to this user, allowing access to S3 and any other services 
         required for your deployment
    - Generate the IAM User's access key and secret key, as we will need them later to configure GitHub 
       Secrets.
   - Step 6: Set Up GitHub Secrets for AWS Credentials
   - Go to your GitHub repository, click on "Settings," then "Secrets." go to actions Here, click on "New 
      Repository Secret"  to add your AWS access key and secret key as secrets named AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and 
       AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, respectively
  - Step 7: Create the GitHub Actions Workflow
  - In your GitHub repository, navigate to the "Actions" tab and click on "Set up a workflow yourself."
  - Create a new file named .github/workflows/main.yml
 
  - name: Handtime

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2  # Updated to v2 for the latest version

      - name: Configure AWS Credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
        with:
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws-region: us-east-1

      - name: Deploy static site to S3 bucket
        run: aws s3 sync . s3://handtimebucket --delete  # Corrected syntax, added "." to sync current 
           directory
- Step 8: Commit Changes and Trigger Deployment
- Step 9: Enable Static Website Hosting for the S3 Bucket
- Step 10: Access Your Portfolio Website üåê
